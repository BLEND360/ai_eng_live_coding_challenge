# Python Coding Challenges â€“ Rate Limiting & Data Refactoring

This repository contains two practical coding exercises designed to assess real-world Python engineering skills:

- **Rate Limiting Logic** using a mock API
- **DataFrame Refactoring** for data processing and transformation

Each module includes implementation code and accompanying `pytest`-based tests.

## ðŸ§  Exercise 1: Rate Limiting

Located in `rate_limiting/`.

### Description:

Implements logic to call `MockAPI.call()` safely, avoiding a `RateLimitError` when more than 5 requests are made within 5 seconds.

### Test:

```bash
pytest rate_limiting/tests/test_api.py
```

---

## ðŸ§  Exercise 2: Data Refactoring

Located in `refactor/`.

### Description

Refactor the code provided in `refactor/data_processor.py`, ensure all tests pass.

### Test:

```bash
pytest refactor/tests/test_data_processor.py
```
